# EENG426Lab2
Repo for Fall 2022 EENG426, Lab 2 code


# Part 1
Part 1 consists of the implementation of the logic gates, nand2, nor2, an inverter and a c element.
The scripts for the simulation have also been added as well. They can be run in actsim directly to test them.


# Part 2
Part 2 consists of the chp for a 10 place buffer and the simulation code to test it on actsim.
The template for an n place buffer was used here.
For the second part there is an implementation of a priority queue which uses n different single n place buffers. A for loop was used to check each of the elements within the buffer by monitoring the output from the buffer. This script can be run in actsim to test the circuit.
